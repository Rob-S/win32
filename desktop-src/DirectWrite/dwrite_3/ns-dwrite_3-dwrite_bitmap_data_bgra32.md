# DWRITE_BITMAP_DATA_BGRA32 structure (dwrite_3.h)

Represents bitmap data in BGRA32 format.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DWriteCore implementation of [DirectWrite](../direct-write-portal.md). DWriteCore is a form of DirectWrite that runs on versions of Windows down to Windows 8, and opens the door for you to use it cross-platform. For more info, and code examples, see [DWriteCore overview](../dwritecore-overview.md).

## Syntax

```cpp
struct DWRITE_BITMAP_DATA_BGRA32
{
  UINT32 width;
  UINT32 height;
  _Field_size_(width * height) UINT32* pixels;
};
```

## Members

`width`

Type: **[UINT32](../../winprog/windows-data-types.md)**

The width, in pixels, of the bitmap.


`height`

Type: **[UINT32](../../winprog/windows-data-types.md)**

The height, in pixels, of the bitmap.


`pixels`

Type: \_Field\_size\_(width * height)**[UINT32](../../winprog/windows-data-types.md)\***

A pointer to the location of the bit values for the bitmap.


## Examples

See the [DWriteCore overview](../dwritecore-overview.md) topic, and the [DWriteCoreGallery](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Reunion-Samples/tree/main/DWriteCore/DWriteCoreGallery) sample app.
