# DWriteCoreCreateFactory function (dwrite_core.h)

Creates a factory object that is used for subsequent creation of individual DWriteCore objects.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DWriteCore implementation of [DirectWrite](../direct-write-portal.md). DWriteCore is a form of DirectWrite that runs on versions of Windows down to Windows 8, and opens the door for you to use it cross-platform. For more info, and code examples, see [DWriteCore overview](../dwritecore-overview.md).

## Syntax
```cpp
HRESULT DWRITE_EXPORT DWriteCoreCreateFactory(
    _In_ DWRITE_FACTORY_TYPE factoryType,
    _In_ REFIID iid,
    _COM_Outptr_ IUnknown** factory
);
```

## Parameters

`factoryType`

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ne-dwrite-dwrite_factory_type">DWRITE_FACTORY_TYPE</a></b>

A value that specifies whether the factory object will be shared, isolated, or restricted.

`iid`

Type: <b>REFIID</b>

A GUID value that identifies the DirectWrite factory interface, such as __uuidof(<a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritefactory">IDWriteFactory</a>).

`factory`

Type: <b>IUnknown**</b>

An address of a pointer to the newly created DirectWrite factory object.

## Return value

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## Examples

See the [DWriteCore overview](../dwritecore-overview.md) topic, and the [DWriteCoreGallery](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Reunion-Samples/tree/main/DWriteCore/DWriteCoreGallery) sample app.

## Remarks

This is functionally the same as the [DWriteCreateFactory](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-dwritecreatefactory) function exported by the system version of DirectWrite. The DWriteCore function has a different name to avoid ambiguity.
